## Introduction
While the [WebDriver](http://docs.wpm.neustar.biz/testscript-api/biz/neustar/wpm/api/WebDriver.html) and [HttpClient](http://docs.wpm.neustar.biz/testscript-api/biz/neustar/wpm/api/HttpClient.html) interfaces provide WPM with the automation routines for controlling an agent (browser in the case of Selenium and simple HTTP client with HttpClient) they do not provide a mechanism for measuring performance and segmenting that performance into logical steps and transactions.  This functionality is provided by Neustar's [Test](http://docs.wpm.neustar.biz/testscript-api/biz/neustar/wpm/api/Test.html) interface which offers a number of different methods that can be helpful in both performance monitoring and load testing.  In today's post I will just be covering the basic components needed to group page load time metrics into logical steps and transactions.
